# AC-Resolve
A game resolution mechanic to potentially be used with the AttaCard project.

In part, this is also an excuse to experiment with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) to see if it's a viable platform for other work down the line.

The specific idea is a simple library module that can resolve actions for roleplaying-style games using a straightforward, flexible mechanism.
